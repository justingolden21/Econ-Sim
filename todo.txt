======== IDEAS ========
LIMIT FOR HOW MUCH THEY CAN PRODUCE PER PRODUCTION AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD

resources decay or go away over time? food?

make seperate number called sellAvaialble for how much theyre willing to sell, remove reserve

ability to "own" multiple firms and trade among yourself "automatically"/afk

parent passes their price to child

======== NOTES ========
in future there may be production substitutes, you can either have bread OR meat etc.
That will make the supply curve smoother as well

while we do not have money being added to the system through a 'Mint' firm, we need to have the money supply increase here
by deducting less than we add.
for the sake of simplicity, a firm will not need have any of what they produce to expand for now.
if you think about it, you'll see why that's hard to program

want firms to start with money (so they can purchase) however dont want to add money to economy through making new firms. needs to get money from parent, but then money is expand cost

======== TODO ========

Add where firms buy from lowest price to highest
Add firms buying in the proper ratio
Add firms buying their fixed (add to while loop if tic % 10 == 0 (ie is rent day)
then try to buy your requirements, if you can't roll to die. Must watch if this results in
price of lumber fluctuating wildly. (YOU ARE HERE)

Add firms, upon reaching a point of wealth, buying their expansion requirements

add expansion (reproduction), including a 'if this rich, start looking for expansion' item list

add all of 'Bobby's firms'
add graphs and other helpful ways to look at the data
(end backend stuff ver 1.0)

WHY-> the way we buy things, will we build up a reserve that will trigger the 'expandRequirement' conditions?
Possibly, just needs to be tried.

Savings are necessary so that a firm can pay rent, otherwise all of its money will be in product, and if it hasn't sold already it is unlikely to have any cash on hand.

======== DEBUGGING NOTES ========
things that might go wrong in game logic:
	prices go to 1 so they dont deem it worth it to buy
	they cant pay upkeep cost because they sell it all
	they sell of all of their upkeep cost
