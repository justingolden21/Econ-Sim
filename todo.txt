todo and ideas:
logic for firm deciding when to not buy?
	firm buying chooses lowest sell price?
resources decay or go away over time? food?

LIMIT FOR HOW MUCH THEY CAN PRODUCE PER PRODUCTION AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD

ideas for debugging:
prices go to 1 so they dont deem it worth it to buy
they cant pay upkeep cost because they sell it all
they sell of all of their upkeep cost


	make seperate number called sellAvaialble for how much theyre willing to sell
